Place the xml file in your res->layout folder, and the two classes into your src folder

From an activity:


HSVColourPickerDialog = colourDialog = new HSVColourPickerDialog(this,180,180,180);
colourDialog.setColourPickerDoneListener(new ColourPickerDoneListener() {
				
				public void onDone(int color) {
						//Extract Colour
				}
			});

colourDialog.show();






Update The layout as you see Fit
Enjoy
